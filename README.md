# BPI (Basic Payment Interface) - Technical Details

## Overview

BPI (Basic Payment Interface) is a simplified real-time payment system designed to enable instant money transfers, bill payments, and merchant transactions. Inspired by the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system, BPI provides users with a seamless payment experience, supporting both Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Merchant (P2M) transactions. BPI is built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, offering a straightforward interface for digital payments.

This repository provides a technical overview of the BPI system and its key components.

## Key Features

- **Instant Payments**: Enables real-time transactions between different bank accounts, 24/7.
- **Single Account Linking**: Users can link one or more bank accounts to their BPI ID.
- **Secure Payments**: Ensures data protection through encryption and two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **QR Code Payments**: Users can make payments to merchants by scanning QR codes.

## Technical Components

### 1. **BPI Architecture**

The BPI system operates with a modular and scalable architecture consisting of several key components:

- **BPI Application**: The BPI mobile apps that allow users to interact with the system and perform transactions.
- **Banking Infrastructure**: Financial institutions that support BPI and offer back-end systems to handle transaction requests.
- **Central BPI Hub**: The central clearing and settlement system that routes transactions and ensures consistency across the ecosystem.
- **Payment Gateways**: Merchant payment systems that allow businesses to accept BPI transactions.

### 2. **BPI Transaction Flow**

A typical BPI transaction follows these key steps:

1. **User Initiates Transaction**: The sender initiates a transaction via their BPI app, either by entering a recipient’s BPI ID or scanning a QR code.
2. **Transaction Routing**: The transaction request is routed through the central BPI hub, which determines the recipient’s bank.
5. **Transaction Confirmation**: Both sender and receiver receive confirmation of the successful transaction.

### 3. **Key Technologies Used in BPI**

- **Real-Time Payment System**: BPI operates on a real-time payment model similar to IMPS, facilitating instant money transfers.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All transactions are encrypted to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For added security, users must verify transactions using a PIN or OTP (One-Time Password).
- **QR Code Payments**: BPI supports merchant and peer-to-peer payments via dynamic QR codes for quick and easy transactions.

### 4. **BPI APIs**

BPI integrates with several APIs to handle transaction requests, account validation, and status updates:

- **Payment Initiation API**: Facilitates the initiation of payments between the sender and receiver.
- **Account Verification API**: Ensures the recipient’s BPI ID is correct and validates their bank account before proceeding.
- **Transaction Status API**: Provides real-time updates on the transaction's status.
- **Bank Authorization API**: Used by banks to verify and authorize payments within the BPI ecosystem.

### 5. **BPI Security Model**

BPI is designed with security as a top priority. Here’s how the security mechanisms are implemented:

- **PIN Authentication**: Users authenticate each transaction with a secure BPI PIN, ensuring that only authorized users can make payments.
- **Encryption**: All communication between the user’s app, the bank, and the BPI hub is encrypted using modern encryption standards like AES and TLS.
- **OTP**: For certain high-value transactions, an OTP is sent to the user’s registered mobile number to ensure secure processing.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Some BPI apps support biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) to simplify secure access to the app.

### 6. **Common BPI Error Codes**

When a BPI transaction fails, users may encounter specific error codes. Below are some of the most common:

| Error Code | Description                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `1`     | Insufficient funds in the sender's account. |
| `2`     | Invalid BPI ID format.                 |
| `3`     | Recipient's bank is unreachable.       |
| `4`     | Incorrect PIN entered.                 |
